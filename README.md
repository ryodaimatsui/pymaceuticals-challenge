As part of an ongoing research for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer, at Pymaceuticals, Inc., this analysis looks at data gathered from 249 mice who were identified with SCC and treated with a wide range of drug regimens.

As part of data analysis, we first generated a dataframe from two CSV data files. Following this, we identified a duplicate mouse and generated a new dataframe after removing the mouse. This new, clean dataframe was used to generate the charts contained in the file titled, 'Pymaceuticals, Inc..ipynb'. Upon analysis, the findings is as follows:

- As evident in the scatter plot which assesses the relationship between the mouse weight and the average tumor size of mice in the Capomulin drug regimen, there is a strong correlation — roughly, 0.84 — between the two factors. 

- The drug regimens of 'Capomulin' and 'Ramicane' were both effective in treating the tumor, with the former being slightly more effective.

- On the contrary, 'Infubinol' and 'Ceftamin' seemingly had the adverse effect of increasing the size of the tumors. This conclusion, however, is not certain at this time as there may be other factors that may have lead to this.
